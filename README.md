A web application that allows user to easily split expenses with others.
You can watch a demonstration video **<a href="https://youtu.be/4_yymIpAqs0">here</a>.

### Features
The program is built using the **Flask** web framework, which provides the backend functionality and serves as the web server.
**Bootstrap** is utilized as the frontend.
The database system is handled by **SQLite3**, which employs storage and management of the program's data.

### Description

 ### Contributions
 This application was solely done by myself for the final project for **Harvard University's CS50x**. 
 The template from "pset9 finance" was used, alongside my own flair.
